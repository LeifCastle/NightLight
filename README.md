This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Night Light
  The Night Light app gives lucid dreamers a simple way to dream journal, explore lucidity charts and stats, and connect with other lucid dreamers


### Dream Journal
  The Dream Journal gives users an easy way to record their dreams and log various data entries relating to them such as lucidity, methods, and of course dreams themselves.

  ### Quick_Record
    Quick Record gives users an option to quickly jot down their dreams along with notes without having to input any other data. The intended use is for when they first wake up in the morning or especially in the middle of the night and they just want to record and go back to sleep.  Future features would include putting these "dream drafts" in a location where the user can later touch them up with more data / edit them.
